Plotting may be a time and energy-consuming task, however it only has to be done once.\n\n\nThe disk space you dedicate to Burst can't be used otherwise once plotted (unless you delete the plot files) so make sure you can truly afford the space dedicated to mining Burst.\n\n\nHDD disk space will be occupied by \nplot files\n. Plot files are like bingo cards that contain pre-solved responses to the cryptographic problem that the blockchain poses to miners each and every round.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nFind out how much you can make with the capacity at your disposal using a \nmining calculator\n.\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the disk space you wish to dedicate to mining Burst can be accomplished multiple ways, several plotters exist for different operating systems. CPU based plotters (in contrast to GPU based plotting software) generally create optimized plot files. This means your plot files will be of the highest possible quality and efficiency. So be aware, how you are generating your plot files.\n\n\n\n\nPlot files\n\n\nThere are a few things you have to understand to get a general overview of the nature of plot files.\n\n\nPlot files consist of \nnonces\n which contain the cryptographic solutions you will be mining with.\n\n\n\n\n1 nonce = 262144 bytes\n\n\n\n\nPlot file size is measured in nonces so you will have to convert the size of your dedicated disk space to nonces. Nonce calculators exist to make this process easier.\n\n\nNonces are ordered \nlinearly\n in \nsequential order\n. the number they're assigned to is arbitrary but they should \nnever\u00a0overlap\n (overlapping reduces plot efficiency and triggers an error in most mining software).",
