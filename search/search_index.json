You have to choose one of them, which is used to store the blockchain. We recommend MariaDB as database for the Burst Reference Software.\n\n\nMariaDB\n\n\nThe following \ndocker-compose.yml\n file can be used to run the BRS with MariaDB database in containers.\n\n\nversion\n:\n \n3\n\n\n\nservices\n:\n\n  \nburstcoin\n:\n\n    \nimage\n:\n \nburstcoin/core:1.3.6cg-mariadb\n\n    \nrestart\n:\n \nalways\n\n    \ndepends_on\n:\n\n     \n-\n \nmariadb\n\n    \nports\n:\n\n     \n-\n \n8123:8123\n\n     \n-\n \n8125:8125\n\n  \nmariadb\n:\n\n    \nimage\n:\n \nmariadb:10\n\n    \nenvironment\n:\n\n     \n-\n \nMYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=burstwallet\n\n     \n-\n \nMYSQL_DATABASE=burstwallet\n\n    \nvolumes\n:\n\n     \n-\n \n./burst_db:/var/lib/mysql\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the file and run it.\n\n\ndocker-compose up -d\n\n\n\n\nWith the \n-d\n flag, both containers are started as background processes. A \nburst_db\n folder will be created in the directory of the \ndocker-compose.yml\n file, if it was not created before. This folder is mounted to the MariaDB storage and holds the \nburstwallet\n database containing the blockchain. The containers can be stopped and removed at any time via \ndocker-compose down\n. With the next start, the \nburst_db\n folder will be mounted again and your previous blockchain status will be loaded.\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nYou may encounter an PoolInitializationError when not clearing containers on restart of the docker-compose.yml. In case there are old containers, remove them with \ndocker rm $(docker ps -a -q)\n\n\n\n\nH2\n\n\nAlternatively, H2 can be used as database to store the blockchain. H2 is an embedded database, therefore one does not have to run it in a separate container.

With Xplotter, that is all the technical knowledge you need to operate the software and to create an optimized plot file.   To execute Xplotter, it is necessary to create a run script -  run.bat . This batch contains the parameters for Xplotter, e.g. where and how much to plot and the resources to consume to do so.   Go into the Xplotter directory and create a new file called  run.bat  with your preferred text editor (Notepad / Notepad++). Copy   Paste the following command into the file:   @setlocal\n@cd /d %~dp0\nXPlotter_avx.exe -id  your numeric account ID  -sn  starting nonce  -n  total nonces  -t  threads to use  -path  path Z:\\plots -mem  amount of RAM to use   Replace the parameters according to your needs.    -id  your numeric account ID  This can be found by clicking your account's name in your wallet and copying the numeric account ID.    -sn  starting nonce  If this is your first time ever plotting it is recommended to start your nonce with 0 (ZERO).    -n  total nonces    -t  threads to use  This refers to your machine's CPU architecture: if your CPU has multiple cores you can use them, otherwise put '1' here.    -P  path  where you want to store your plot files (for example 'D:/Burst/Plots', but any path will suffice).    -mem  amount of RAM to use  The amount of RAM in gigabytes you wish to utilize during this process.     Warning  Never exceed recommended RAM usage! Always leave around 20% remaining RAM for remedial tasks.    Example  Your file content should look similiar to the following lines. @setlocal\n@cd /d %~dp0\nXPlotter_avx.exe -id 17559140197979902351 -sn 0 -n 20000 -t 4 -path F:\\burst\\plots -mem 5G",
